# Helix

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/penberg/helix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/penberg/helix)

Helix is an ultra low-latency market data feed handler written in C++. It provides an API to trading applications that normalizes market data updates from multiple feeds.

Helix core does not include networking functionality and expects applications to provide raw packet data.

## Building

Helix requires libuv 1.0 or later. If you build it from sources, you need to tell pkg-config where to find the configuration files:

```
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/
```

## Usage

To convert a NASDAQ TotaView-ITCH 5.0 file to CVS:

```
./helix-trace -i 07302015.NASDAQ_ITCH50 -s AAPL -c nasdaq-binaryfile-itch50 -f csv -o AAPL.csv
```

Please note that Helix only works with uncompressed files.
